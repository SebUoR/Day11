    "I am really interesting in artificial intellegence as a whole. It's such a facisnating and powerful technology and it's growing  fast, doing incredible things and only getting more incredible. I think that it has the potential to be really benifitial however it also has a lot of scary and risky aspects to it, and my articles outline both of those sides. They talk about all of the benifits that AI is providing us as we speak as well as in the future. It's transforming industries by operating time consuming or error-prone processes, and it streamlines development by speeding up data analysis in many different places. It's helping with automating so many tasks as well as managing small buisnesses. At the same time though, it comes with many risks and downsides. People are worried about about AI perpetuating previous biases. Because it's based on data sets, it's very possible that it is able to pick up on and repeat human bias, and it's been seen to do this many times. This could  be very damaging, but of course it doesn't stop there. They talk about ethical concerns, and we're already seeing AI being used in many different forms of warfare. All in all I still thing AI is awesome in general and while I'm definitly worried about the possible and even the current risks and downsides, I still can't help but feel excited for what's to come."
